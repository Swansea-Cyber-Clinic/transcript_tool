# transcript_tool

## About
transcript_tool is a Python script for automagically correcting transcripts generated by Microsoft Office's transcription service. Transcripts generated using this service tend to have a lot of extraneous information, which is cumbersome to remove manually. This typically manifests as far too many indications of current speaker along with timecodes, an example of which is given below.

Let me get this straight, is she doing what I think she's doing?

00:42:45 The Cat
Why? What do you think she's doing?

00:42:48 David Lister
Playing pool with planets.

00:42:51 Arnold Judas Rimmer
Is that possible?

00:42:53 David Lister
Well, it's not going to work, it's completely insane.

00:42:56 David Lister
It's whacko, it's noodle-doodle.

00:42:59 The Cat
I'm with you, buddy.

00:43:01 David Lister
No, not the idea, the shot. There's not enough side.

00:43:05 Arnold Judas Rimmer
"Side"?

00:43:06 David Lister
Yeah, side-spin. It's a complete mis-cue.

00:43:09 Arnold Judas Rimmer
What are you drivelling about, Lister?

00:43:11 Arnold Judas Rimmer
We're talking about a computer with an IQ in excess of 12,000.

00:43:15 David Lister
Doesn't mean she can play pool, I can. Trust me, I know whereof I speak.

00:43:18 David Lister
Aigburth Arms on a Friday night, they used to call me Dave "Cinzano Bianco" Lister 'cause once I was on the table, you couldn't get rid of me.

00:43:24 David Lister
This pool arm is as sound as a dollarpound, and I promise you that shot will not come off.

00:43:28 David Lister
She's topped it, that's what she's done, she's topped it!  It's a felt-ripper! That planet is off the table and into somebody's pint of beer.

00:43:37 Arnold Judas Rimmer
We are talking about the trigonomics of four-dimensional space, you simple-minded gimboid!

00:43:45 Arnold Judas Rimmer
We are not talking about some seedy game of pool in a backstreet Scouse drinking pit.

The script transforms the previous into:

## Usage
You'll need Python 3 installed, as well as a plaintext version of the transcript. You should be able to get one by converting the file from `.docx` to `.txt` using [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) or by using Microsoft Word's inbuilt 'Save-as' feature.

Run the script, providing a path to the input file, and optionally a path to the proposed output file (including filename). Use the `-h` flag for more information on command-line arguments.

```zsh
$ pwd
/Users/kryten

$ python3 convert.py ~/Documents/white_hole_nonsense_transcript.txt -o ~/Documents/white_hole_nonsense_transcript_converted.txt
```
